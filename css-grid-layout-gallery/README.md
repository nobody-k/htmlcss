This is the source code for the video I made on how cool CSS grid layouts are when I first learned about them. This is not the original code, which I did not publish at the time. I recreated the code from watching at the video because it appears to have become popular and this may be useful to others.

### Things to Note
* The images are taken from the [Pexels website](www.pexels.com) and are **not** my own work. The only thing of mine in here is the source code.
* Picture thumbnails must be the same aspect ratio for it to work gracefully, but be very large.
